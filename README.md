# Sublime ENSIME

This project provides integration with ENSIME and Sublime Text Editor 2.
It's a fork of the original sublime-ensime project, written by Ivan Porto Carrero.
This fork introduces stability improvements, user-friendly setup and error messages,
better logging and works with the latest pre-release version of Scala 2.10.

Sublime ENSIME strives to realize the dream of having Scala semantic services
inside a lightning fast and feature-rich text editor. Big thanks to Aemon Cannon, 
Daniel Spiewak and Ivan Porto Carrero who demonstrated that this vision is possible
and inspired us to kick off the project.

## Project status

SublimeScala project is an early alpha. Some basic things might work (for example, error highlighting), 
but basically anything might blow up in your face. Please, submit issues to our tracker 
if you catch SublimeScala doing that: https://github.com/sublimescala/sublime-ensime/issues/new.

Also note that SublimeScala uses pre-release Scala compiler (which roughly corresponds to 2.10.0-M6). 
This might also produce funny bugs. Use our bug reporting facility to report those: 
https://issues.scala-lang.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa.

Anyways this venture is very important for the project maintainers, since we use Scala every day, 
so we'll do our best to release something workable before the final release of Scala 2.10.0.

The first release will include go to definition (aka ctrl+click) and on-the-fly error highlighting.
We'd also love to add debugging facilities at some point in the future.

## How to install?

1. Install the package itself:

    In your Sublime Text `Packages` dir (you can find it by `Preferences -> Browse Packages`), invoke:

    ```
    git clone git://github.com/sublimescala/sublime-ensime.git sublime-ensime
    ```

2. Install Ensime.

    Download Ensime from http://download.sublimescala.org. 
    The archive will contain a directory with an Ensime version. 
    Extract the contents of this directory into the `server` subdirectory 
    of just created `sublime-ensime` directory. If you everything correctly,
    `sublime-ensime/server/bin` will contain Ensime startup scripts and
    `sublime-ensime/server/lib` will contain Ensime binaries.

3. (Re)start Sublime Text editor.

## How to use?

Open the Sublime command palette (typically bound to `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Ensime: Startup`.
