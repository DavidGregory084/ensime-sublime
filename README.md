# Sublime Ensime

This project provides an integration with ensime and Sublime Text Editor 2.
Sublime as an outstanding API so it should be possible to get all of ensime's features in Sublime Text Editor 2.

## What's working?
Now nothing yet, working out how to start and initialize a server currently.

## What's planned?
To implement all the features of ensime.

## Wishlist?
I'd like to use the information we get back from ensime to provide semantic highlighting.
